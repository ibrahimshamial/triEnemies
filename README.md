# triEnemies
A simple game In Python made using the pygame library (https://www.pygame.org)

This is a small project which I made to sharpen my concepts in Object Oriented Programming in Python. 
It was fun and challenging and an overall great learning experience. Programming a game, even a simple one like this makes you fully use your imagination to visualize simple things like movement between different frames, collision, boundries. You tend to apreciate the amount of brain work which goes into writing a game.

The game is fully functional and playable, just run the Game2.py file with python 3. 

The Main character is the blue square box which can shoot red bullets in the direction in which it is moving. Use the arrow keys to move around and spacebar to shoot the bullets in the direction of movement. Enemies get destroyed when bullet hits them. Collison with the enemies results in the Game Over Screen.

Although the game is fully functional in its current state, there are areas for improvement which I plan to work on at a later stage. One of them is to implement a ramp up difficulty level as the time passes so that newer emnemies are spawned with a higher rate or a higher speed as the game progresses. Currently there are no new enemies added other than the initial ones.


Please feel free to reuse the code if you like. Also suggestions and feedback will be highly appreciated. Thanks for reading ! :)
